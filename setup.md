## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run in a [repl.it](https://repl.it/) Python environment.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Setting up Python with [repl.it][replit-website]

In this lesson, we will be using a Python 3 environment on [repl.it][replit-website] online.
We will use some of Python's most popular scientific libraries.
Guidance will be provided for use in [repl.it][replit-website].
[repl.it][replit-website] is a free online integrated development environment (IDE).
An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. 
[repl.it][replit-website] gives you an instant IDE to learn, build, and collaborate.

## Alternatively: Setting up Python yourself

You can install Python and use an your own IDE separately.
We recommend installing [Anaconda][anaconda-website] for Python,
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson.
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found
on The Carpentries [template website for workshops][anaconda-instructions]
and in [Anaconda documentation][anaconda-install].
We recommend [Visual Studio Code][vscode-website] for a full-featured IDE.
[Visual Studio Code][vscode-website] is free and supports most code development needs.
